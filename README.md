</p>

**Omega_Gomoku_AI** is not only used for Gomoku game, but you can also customize the size of the board and an n-in-a-row game. Tic-tac-toe, for example, is a 3-in-a-row game, and played on a board of size 3.

This repo provides a ~~visual game interface~~, easy-to-use training process, and easy-to-understand code. 

Enjoy yourself ~~~
