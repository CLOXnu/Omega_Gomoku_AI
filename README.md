# Omega_Gomoku_AI

**Omega_Gomoku_AI** is a Gomoku game AI based on Monte Carlo Tree Search. It's written in Python.

</p>

**Omega_Gomoku_AI** is not only used for Gomoku game, but you can also customize the size of the board and an n-in-a-row game. Tic-tac-toe, for example, is a 3-in-a-row game, and played on a board of size 3.

This repo provides a ~~visual game interface~~, easy-to-use training process, and easy-to-understand code. 

Enjoy yourself ~~~

## Usage

You can try **Omega_Gomoku_AI** yourself, and there are two ways to try it.

### via Docker

If you have installed Docker, run the following command:

```shell
$ docker pull clox/omega_gomoku_ai:1.0
```

And, just run this:

```shell
$ docker run -it clox/omega_gomoku_ai:1.0
```

Add `--rm` after `-it` can automatically remove the container when it exits.

That's all, It's a really simple way!

*PS: The compressed size of the Docker image is about **350 MB**.*

### via PC/Mac/Linux

Make sure you have a Python environment installed on your computer, and after cloning this repo, then run the following command:

```shell
$ pip install -r requirement.txt
```

If necessary, the command 'pip' should be changed to 'pip3'.

In Mac/Linux, just run this:

```shell
$ bash game.sh
```

is enough. Or, you can also run:

```shell
$ python configure.py
```

to configure the game, and run:

```shell
$ python start.py
```

to start the game.

Either installation way is fairly simple.


## Enjoy...

By default, this is a 5-in-a-row game played on an 8 * 8 size of board, and AI with pure MCTS searches 2,000 times each turn.

![AI_moves](Image/AI_moves.png)

Sometimes, AI with pure MCTS may do weird action, because 2,000 times searching is not enough in a 5-in-a-row game in fact. So you can adjust the board size to 3 * 3 or 6 * 6, set to a 3-in-a-row or 4-in-a-row game, like tac-tic-toe.

Sure, It's a good idea to adjust 2,000 times to more, but it will take more time to think.

![10000_times](Image/10000_times.png)

For example, I adjusted the number of Monte Carlo tree searches to 10,000 and played a 4-in-a-row game on a 6 * 6 board. It can be seen in the AI analysis that the Monte Carlo tree has traversed almost all of the board.

~~Will, AI with MCTS + neural network can solve this problem.~~
